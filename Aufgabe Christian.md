# Programming task Frontend/JavaScript

As a Software Team, we would like to see some of your work. In the following you'll find a short task, on which you can work on your own and share your solution with us. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask your interviewer.

## Create a Web-Form

This might seem easy to you and it probably is. Please consider this task not as a difficult problem for you just to solve, but to demonstrate your problem solution ability as well as your working style.

**These are your requirements:**

* create a Webpage that shows a customer form 
* the form contains a number and a text input
* the form contains a group of Checkboxes    
* create a Checkbox, for the Selection and Deselecction of all the Checkboxes
* create a Script, which makes this Checkbox functional
* create a button that prints out all the data that was collected from the form

**What you should take care of:**

* please use git Version Control for your project
* choose any Technology that you would like
* host the project either public or in private mode on a Platform like Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket
* share the project with your Interviewer

## Advanced

Consider all the above tasks plus these requirements:

* you use basic form validation and print out errors
* your form posts to a mock api (e.g: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/ or you can create an own API)
* send some type of authentication with the request (choose a method and just fill it with some mock data)
* you have a submit / loading state
* you print out some result. This can be your data input or the answer of the API

Moreover as advanced programmer your solution should:

* be dockerized so it is flexible to run in any environment
* your code should be typed (in JS for example please use Typescript)

That's it. Have fun!
